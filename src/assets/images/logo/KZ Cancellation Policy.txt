Cancellation Policy
1. Traveler-Initiated Cancellations
We understand that plans can change unexpectedly. The following cancellation fees and refund eligibility apply based on the time of cancellation prior to the tourâ€™s departure date.
14 Days or Less Before Departure: No refund will be issued, and 100% of the tour cost is non-refundable
15-60 Days Before Departure: Cancellation incurs a fee of 20%, with a partial refund of the remaining balance.

Non-Refundable Deposits: Please note that deposits paid at the time of booking are non-refundable, except in cases where Kayzoe Tours cancels the tour.

Company-Initiated Cancellations
In the rare event that Kayzoe Tours needs to cancel a tour due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., natural disasters, safety concerns, or low enrollment), you will be offered the following options:
Full Refund: A full refund of all amounts paid, including the deposit.
Tour Rescheduling or Credit: You may transfer your booking to a future date or choose an alternative tour with no additional fees.
Note: Kayzoe Tours is not liable for additional costs incurred by travelers, such as flights, visas, or accommodation bookings outside the tour package.

Refund Processing
Refunds are processed within 7 days of receiving the cancellation request. Payment method fees and international transaction fees are non-refundable, and refunds are issued in the original form of payment.

Special Circumstances and Travel Insurance
Travel Insurance: We highly recommend travel insurance that includes trip cancellation coverage to protect your investment. Kayzoe Tours is not responsible for non-refundable costs due to last-minute cancellations.
Exceptions: In exceptional circumstances, such as medical emergencies or family bereavement, please contact us directly. We will make every effort to accommodate reasonable requests, but refunds or credits are not guaranteed.
